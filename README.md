I've implemented various path finding algorithms in the past including A* but had the sudden urge to create a maze solver and so I found myself, once again, working with A* to accomplish this task.


User's can use the mouse and click a square to create the walls of the maze or drag the mouse around while triggering the left mouse button and build it that way (as you can undoubtedly see in the video provided). To set a start and end point press 1 and 2 respectively then click the desired square. Reset the maze by pressing F5. You can alter the heuristic from Euclidean to Manhattan distance by pressing 4 and 3 respectively.

Used: Pyglet.
